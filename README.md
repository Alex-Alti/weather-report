# weather-report
Raspberry Pi Project, featuring a Inky wHAT e-ink display.
    # The Weather Report is meant to display the weather in a more visually pleasing layout,
    # which will combine assets such as hourly readings, date and time, and whatever comes along.
    
    # The idea is to create a UI that resembles something like a dashboard that you'd see on TV or in a car.
